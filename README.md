# ðŸ“Ÿ Prospect JavaScript Coding Challenge

Prospect integrates with several third-party APIs and services.

This application is an **uptime monitor** to monitor our third-party API integrations.

## Usage

The application should start automatically in StackBlitz's browser. 

To modify the application, create a **Fork** and modify your Fork.

To debug the application, we recommend you use your browser's 'Console' instead of the one provided by StackBlitz.
